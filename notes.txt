 to access cloud db, port forward your fly postgres db as shown below
 to access via localhost 6543
 fly proxy 6543:5432 -a zero2prodrusttutorial-db

when the proxy is running you are able to execute "sqlx migrate run"
if your .env database url is configured to hit the localhost
and the right table name in your cloud db
